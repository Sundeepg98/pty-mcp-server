# Future Enhancements for Dynamic Environment Feature

## Potential Improvements

### 1. Multiple Environment File Support
- Support for `.env.local`, `.env.development`, `.env.production`
- Precedence order: `.env.local` > `.env.{NODE_ENV}` > `.env`
- Allow specifying environment via activate command

### 2. Environment Variable Validation
- Schema validation for required environment variables
- Type checking (string, number, boolean, url)
- Warning for missing required variables

### 3. Security Enhancements
- Automatic secret masking in logs (detect patterns like API_KEY, PASSWORD, TOKEN)
- Encrypted storage for sensitive variables
- Audit log for environment variable access

### 4. Developer Experience
- `env-info` tool to display current environment state
- `env-validate` tool to check .env file syntax
- Environment variable interpolation (e.g., `BASE_URL=${HOST}:${PORT}`)
- Auto-completion for environment variables in exec commands

### 5. Advanced Features
- Environment inheritance between projects
- Environment templates for new projects
- Environment sync with cloud providers (AWS Parameter Store, etc.)
- Hot-reload of .env files without project re-activation

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority**: env-info tool (visibility into current state)
2. **Medium Priority**: Multiple env file support, validation
3. **Low Priority**: Advanced features like inheritance and cloud sync

## Architectural Considerations

All enhancements should:
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Follow existing dependency injection patterns
- Respect the constraint that PTY sessions cannot have dynamic environment
- Keep the implementation simple and maintainable
