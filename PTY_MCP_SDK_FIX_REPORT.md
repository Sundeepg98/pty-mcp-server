# PTY MCP SDK Fix Report

## Status: READY FOR TESTING ✅

### Problem Identified
The PTY MCP server was disconnecting frequently because it wasn't using the proper MCP SDK. Instead, it had a custom JSON protocol implementation that didn't properly handle the MCP/JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol.

### Solution Implemented
Completely rewrote the PTY server to use the official Python MCP SDK (`mcp>=1.0.0`).

### Key Changes
1. **Proper MCP SDK Integration**:
   - Added `mcp>=1.0.0` to requirements
   - Imported proper MCP classes: `Server`, `NotificationOptions`, `InitializationOptions`
   - Used `mcp.server.stdio.stdio_server()` for proper stdio handling

2. **Protocol Implementation**:
   - Implemented `@server.list_tools()` decorator for tool discovery
   - Implemented `@server.call_tool()` decorator for tool execution
   - Proper JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol handling through MCP SDK

3. **Fixed Initialization**:
   - Proper server capabilities handling
   - Correct InitializationOptions with required fields
   - Successfully responds to initialize requests

### Testing Completed
✅ Server starts without errors
✅ Responds to JSON-RPC initialize requests
✅ Returns proper server info and capabilities
✅ Launch script works correctly

### To Test with Claude Code

1. **Update your Claude configuration** to use the experimental version:
   ```bash
   # Edit ~/.claude.json
   # Change the PTY command from:
   "/home/sundeep/.claude/mcp/pty/launch.sh"
   # To:
   "/var/projects/mcp-servers/pty-mcp-python/launch.sh"
   ```

2. **Restart Claude Code** to apply the new configuration

3. **Test PTY commands** to verify stability:
   - Try `mcp__pty__exec` commands
   - Try `mcp__pty__bash` for interactive sessions
   - Monitor for any disconnection issues

### Branch Information
- **Branch**: `fix/mcp-sdk-integration`
- **Location**: `/var/projects/mcp-servers/pty-mcp-python/`
- **Commits**: 
  - a942ea9: Rewrite with proper MCP SDK
  - 3aea2ac: Update launch script

### Next Steps
1. Test with Claude Code for stability
2. If stable (no disconnections), merge to master
3. Copy to production location (`/home/sundeep/.claude/mcp/pty/`)
4. Implement UVX support (optional, lower priority)

### Files Changed
- `main.py` - Complete rewrite with MCP SDK
- `launch.sh` - Updated for new implementation
- `requirements.txt` - Added MCP SDK dependency

### Expected Result
The PTY MCP server should now stay connected continuously without requiring frequent reconnection, matching the stability of other MCP servers.
